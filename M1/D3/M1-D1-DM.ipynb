About data management"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nFyhF-jp06qB"},"source":["Handling or managing data involves many steps and technologies at many levels. Data may be colleccted by sensors. It can be a camera, a temperature sensor, a telescope, a microscope (with a camera), a microphone, a particle detector etc. Normally the data is then digitised, maybe preprocessed and written to some media in a certain format, e.g. as a comma separated value (csv) file to a hard disk. This part of the data management is normally taken care of by engineers.\n","\n","Data may also be collected from all sorts of databases, so data already collected somehow. Time series of financial data, customers, passengers, facebook likes, twitter tweets etc. This is data which is normally already on a media with some interface for access, e.g. paper to be read by a camera, a file on youtube, a table on wikipedia etc. We will look at some ways to collect such data. Some programming and computer skills are needed to do so. It may be that this part of the data management is taken care of by specialised computer scientists, but it may also be expected from a data scientist to have these skills.\n","\n","Analysing data with statisitical and machine learning tools, requires that the data is colleceted, cleaned and prepared for the tools. *This is very often a very large part of a data analytics project and a prerequisite*. It may involve removing bad data, filter out redundant and noisy data, unify the formats and types, transform the data etc.\n","Thus, a data scientist must be able to perform this part of the data management. This notebook shows the basic operations with Python pandas. With other tools the concepts and operations are very similar.\n","\n","After the data analysis, after the extraction of information and the creation of knowledge, the data is often stored or archived for the future (if this seems cheaper than regenerating the data at a later point). In larger institutions this part of the data management may include educated librarians and others, not necessarily the data scientist.  \n","\n","**In this notebook we only look at a few examples on how to do datamanagement with dataframes. Pandas are extremly powerful and we cannot show everything in a couple of hours. You will become more and more experienced when you work on your module projects. Probably whatever you want to do with your dataframe, there is a way to do it. If not, it probably doesn't make much sense what wou want to do.**\n","\n","Any questions?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z4HJ8cnp06qC"},"source":["## 1.
